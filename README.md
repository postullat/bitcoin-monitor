## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Download the repo
2. Install NPM packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Configuration

### .env File

The application uses a `.env` file to manage configuration settings. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following variables:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: URL of the API endpoint to fetch Bitcoin price data.
- `REACT_APP_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: Interval (in minutes) at which the application updates the price data.

Example `.env` file:
`makefile
    REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com/bitcoin-prices
    REACT_APP_UPDATE_INTERVAL=15
    `

### Changing the API URL

To change the API URL from which the application fetches data, update the `REACT_APP_API_URL` variable in the `.env` file.

## Usage

After starting the development server, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Interacting with the Dashboard

- **Select Date Range:** Use the date picker to select the range of dates for which you want to view Bitcoin prices.
- **Change Candle Size:** Use the dropdown menu to select the candle size (1D, 1W, 1M).
- **Manual Data Refresh:** Click on the "Last Update" timestamp to manually refresh the data.

## Marker Functionality

Users can place and remove markers on the candlestick chart to highlight specific price points such as the highest or lowest prices in the selected date range. Markers are displayed as yellow diamonds on the chart and can be interacted with as follows:

Web Version:

- **Remove Marker**: Drag the marker off the screen to delete it.

## API

The application fetches Bitcoin price data from a specified API endpoint. Ensure that the API returns data in the expected format for the application to function correctly.

Example API response:

```json
[
  {
    "date": "2023-01-01",
    "open": 29000,
    "high": 29500,
    "low": 28500,
    "close": 29050
  },
  {
    "date": "2023-01-02",
    "open": 29050,
    "high": 29200,
    "low": 28800,
